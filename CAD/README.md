# CAD

Welcome to the CAD folder!
Here can basically every physical part of a ChrisBox assembly be found. The assembly is shown below.
The CAD is made with Siemens NX, and STL data is provided, e.g. for 3D printing.

## Content of the CAD folder

- `./Casing` - Siemens NX part files for the casing.
- `./Electric` - Electric components of the assembly (PCB with most components, a standard Battery and the NX3224K024 display). 
- `./STLs` - STL data of the casing, e.g. for 3D printing
- `./data` - pictures of the assembly

## Building the casing

For building instructions refer to [BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS](/BUILDING_INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Alternate Version without the Nextion screen

If you are only interested in a Chrisbox without a display, you will find a protective case for the PCB in the “00_VersionWithoutScreen” folder.
