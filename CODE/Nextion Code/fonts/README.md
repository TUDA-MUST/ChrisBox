License: see the file in this folder (`OFL.txt` for SIL Open Font License 1.1, or `LICENSE.txt` for Apache-2.0) that shipped with the Google Fonts ZIP we used.

The Nextion `THEFONT.zi` and the compiled `.tft` contain rasterized data derived from Roboto and are covered by the same Roboto font license.
