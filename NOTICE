TU Darmstadt and contributors

This project includes or depends on third-party components. Each retains its
own license as noted below.

— Runtime/toolchain dependencies (not distributed in this repo) —
• Arduino core for ESP32 — © Espressif Systems — LGPL-2.1
  Used for esp_now.h, WiFi.h, SPI, HardwareSerial, etc.

• ESP-IDF (indirectly via Arduino core) — © Espressif Systems — Apache-2.0
  Used indirectly by Arduino-ESP32.

— Source files included or derived within this repo —
• ProtoCentral ADS1220 library (modified)
  © 2018 Ashwin Whitchurch / ProtoCentral — MIT
  Our files retain the original MIT header comments.

• Fonts (used for Nextion assets)
  Roboto — © Google and contributors — (SIL OFL 1.1) or (Apache-2.0)
  See fonts/Roboto/ for the exact TTF(s) and the bundled license file
  (OFL.txt or LICENSE.txt). The Nextion `Font 1.zi` and `.tft` embed data
  derived from Roboto and are covered by that license.

• KiCad libraries and 3D models
  If any official KiCad library assets (symbols/footprints/3D) are copied
  into this repository, they are licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0 with the
  KiCad libraries’ design-use exception. If the project only references
  KiCad’s system libraries via environment variables, this line is
  informational and no redistribution applies.

• Vendor footprints / 3D models (if present)
  Connector/module models or footprints copied from vendors remain
  © their respective owners. See any accompanying per-file license or
  README next to those assets.

Notes:
• Tools used to generate manufacturing artifacts (e.g., JLCPCB KiCad plugin,
  Nextion Editor) are not distributed here; their licenses apply to the tools
  themselves, not to this repository.
• For the licenses that apply to *our* materials, see the top-level LICENSE
  overview and the texts in the LICENSES/ directory.
